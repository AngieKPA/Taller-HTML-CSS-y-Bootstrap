            <p>Bettas are undeniably beautiful, but they’re extremely territorial — making them the complete
                opposite of
                the relatively docile Guppies. Many aquarists say that these two species shouldn’t be kept together,
                but how true is this?

                <h3>Temperament</h3>
                <p>
                    Bettas, especially males, are well known for their high levels of aggression. In the wild, they are
                    constantly fighting other males for dominance and territory.
                    <br>
                    For this reason, it’s best to keep Guppies with a female Betta rather than a male. Females are much
                    less aggressive than males and are more likely to leave the Guppy school alone.
                    <br>
                    Of course, there are always some exceptions to this. Some females can be just as aggressive as
                    males, while some males can be relatively peaceful. The best way to determine whether or not a Betta
                    will be aggressive is to observe its behavior.

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>One of the main reasons why aquarists say never to put Bettas and Guppies together is how similar
                    they are to each other, visually speaking. <br>

                    Guppies and Bettas are both brightly colored fish that have long fins and tails. These similarities
                    in appearance can often lead to aggression, as the Betta may mistake the guppy for a competitor.<br>

                    It’s best to only keep Bettas with guppies that look very different from them. You can also opt for
                    Guppy variants that have duller colors, as these are less likely to trigger the Betta’s aggression
